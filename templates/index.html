  <h1>Internal Confluence Chatbot</h1>
  <p>This is an exploratory use of ChatGPT on our internal Confluence documentation. Basically, we modify in the background your question to add
  some context.</p>
  <p>The context is that of a Confluence note that appears to be the most similar to the question. Similarity in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  is resolved by converting a text into a vector, also called embeddings, and a simple vector similarity metric is used
  to identify texts that are similar.</p>
  <p>Once the most similar document is found, its content is added to the prompt. ChatGPT uses then the context to answer the question.</p>
  <p>Although not perfect, the tool can provide a more useful choice for the document (or documents) to look at to answer your question with more depth.</p>
  <p>Try it!</p>
